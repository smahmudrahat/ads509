Lexical diversity is a measure of how many different words are used in a given set of lyrics. Seeing that Robyn has a lexical diversity of 0.166 compared to Cher's 0.095 suggests Robyn uses a wider variety of words in her songs than Cher does. This finding aligns with an expectation that artists might vary in their word choice and complexity based on their artistic and musical approaches\n"

The + sign in the expression means \"one or more,\" so this pattern will find sequences of any length where there are continuous whitespace characters. Lyrics may include extra spaces, tabs, or carriage returns. To accurately count words (tokens), we need to normalize these whitespaces using regular expressions by `'\\s+'` \n"
